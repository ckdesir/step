      <h1>What's this?</h1>
      <p>Hey! My name is Christopher Desir, but people that
        know me call me Chris. I am originally from New
        Jersey but moved to Delaware at a very young age.
      <p>Ever since I was young, I have been obsessed
        with PC games and with that began my
        fascination for computers. I remember my family only
        having one computer that I would have to
        take turns sharing with my older brother.
        A majority of my time chunk was spent playing
        games made then by gaming publisher Nexon,
        who specialized in the MMORPG and Beat'em up genre.
        (Albeit I was bad, and still am) I later
        also loved to play League of Legends. Late
        2000s and early 2010s was the prime for all of
        these games that I loved so much. Even though
        I was interested in computers, a degree in the field
        wasn't my first thought during high school
        even though it made so much sense.
        Coming to college has been really eye-opening.
      <p>I am currently a freshman at Cornell University
        (Go Big Red!) studying computer science. My reasoning
        for studying comp sci stems from this love for computers
        mentioned earlier. I see now that it's the
        future of the world. The depth of topics is
        <i>extensive</i> and <i>mind boggling</i>. We
        find ourselves utilizing programming
        and computers more and more. There's no limit
        to what you can do and I want to know how I can help expand
        the world of technology and address today's
        challenges (in part to which Google is leading the way).
        Just recently, I saw news of a professor in California
        bridging the gap in computer accessibility in
        that he was able to utilize the motion of one's tongue
        to translate into action — it's things like this that makes
        me appreciate computer science for it's potential.
      <p>I came to this internship knowing little to nothing about
        the world of software engineering to this scale, so I am
        excited to learn so many different things
        and gain first-hand experience.

      <div>This is Collegetown Bagels in Ithaca, NY. One of my
        favorite joints to eat at during any time of the day. They
        have this delicious bagel called the round house that has
        scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, and a hashbrown all on a
        rosemary salt bagel. It's my favorite thing to get.

        prior so trying Mehak was (and still is) a life changing experience.

      <h1>A Blog</h1>
      <h2>The Time My World Changed</h2>
      <h5>Discovering my hidden talent — May 27, 2020</h5>
      <img src="images/ambidex.jpg" alt="A black and white picture 
        two hands covered in dirt." class="blog-image">
      <p class="blog-text">I am realizing now that this isn't so much
        a hidden talent but more so some genetic mechanism. Then again,
        I don't really parade this around much so I guess it could
        be considered hidden? I am ambidextrous. The earliest memory
        to me realizing this "talent" dates back to I believe third
        grade. My teacher then made us practice cursive with these
        thick booklets. These booklets made us write sentences and
        trace over letters over and over again, so you could probably
        imagine my little third-grade self suffering from cramps
        in my usual writing hand. I remember always switching to
        my left hand whenever my right got tired, not knowing that
        people usually aren't able to write with both. I realized
        later the truth once I joined band in middle school, and
        my world has not been the same since.
      <p class="blog-text">I can also vibrate my eyes, quite literally
        changing my world view as everything begins to shake.
        I am also really good at remembering names.

      <h2>My Love for Photography</h2>
      <h5>What? — May 27, 2020</h5>
      <img src="images/utopia.jpg" alt="A picture of
        utopia, futuristic buildings and
        landscapes." class="blog-image">
      <p class="blog-text">I like taking pictures of things I find
        cool or unconvential. I find that they make for interesting
        talking points when shown to someone you know. I took the
        picture you see as the feature image for this blog above
        and it never fails to raise a striking conversation about the
        world we live in and the beauty of it all. I also use
        photography as a means of expression, so I like to take
        pictures that I believe are expressive. People say that a picture
        is worth a thousand words and to me that is very much
        true. The slideshow below showcases images that transmit
        so much through so little.
